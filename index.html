              HotRock™ products are made with SSM rock salt, one of the purist and most sought after deposits of sodium chloride in the world. This unique mineral content naturally reflects a pink hue that enables precision application control while spreading. Even more impressively, it naturally contains other minerals and is produced at a variety of sizes to provide a long-lasting natural melting boost.
            </p>

            <p>
              These attributes were the inspiration behind the HotRock™ brand. This mineral, along with other quality ingredients, allows us to develop high-performing products to meet all of your snow & ice removal needs, no matter the scale.
